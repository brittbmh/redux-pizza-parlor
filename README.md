# React Pizza Parlor

Create a functioning website for a 'Pizza Parlor'. The website should have an interactive menue that customers can click on a button to place the menue item into there cart. After the item as been added to the cart, the customer will hit the "next" button to move to the next page where the customer will input there information such as name, street address, city, zip and if the would like delivery or pick up. Once the information is input the customer can hit another "next" button that will move them to the next page where they can view thier cart items and "checkout" thire order on the click of a button. Adminatrators of the buisness page will have accesse to an "Admin" page that can only be accessed through localhost:3000/#/admin. The admin page will show the order history of all customers.
