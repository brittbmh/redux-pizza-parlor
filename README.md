# React Pizza Parlor
 A fullstack team project. Our team worked to create a pizza parlor website with an interactive menu that allowed a user to place an order for a pizza and checkout. There is also an admin page to review orders. This page can only be accessed through localhost:3000/#/admin. 

### Setup

Create a `pizza_parlor` database. This database is home to three tables; "pizza" which holds the menu items, " orders" which holds the customer information, and "line_item" which hold the order history information. (See SQL notes in database.sql.)

**Start the project with**

````
download this project
npm install
npm run server
npm run client
This will show up in your browser automatically as  [http://localhost:3000/]
